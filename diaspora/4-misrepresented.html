        <h1>Misrepresented</h1>

        <p><b><i>I was angry. Angry at the world, angry at the media, just angry.</b></i>

          <br><br>

          The manner black woman are treated and spoken about is disgusting. Serena Williams too manly to be a woman.
          Everyone having something to say about Michelle Obama. Sandra Bland. Colourism. Seeing how the black women in my life were being treated. <br>I was just mad.

          <br><br>

          Writing this now I feel the same anger.

          <br><br>

          Our <b><i>existence</i></b> is a problem for some people. Black woman have to surpress certain parts of themselves in fear of being seen as the angry black woman. Having
          to work twice as hard, to not only prove to others but themselves they are just as capable. Its a constant cycle of self affirmations and <b><i>fear</i></b>.

          <br><br>

          Fear of being overlooked, failure and even racism. Many have to grow up being cautious, learning to be <b><i>humble</i></b> enough to take things on the chin.

          <br><br>

          I think I was between the age of 10-13, my sister and I had been going to the same swimming pool every summer. It was a free incentive introduced to encourage kids to stay fit during the summer -
          back when <i><b><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/change4life" target="_blank">change 4 life</a></b></i> was pushed by the nhs. We were wearing the same swimming kits every time we went; I wore a full length swim suit and my sister
          a normal one piece with PE shorts on top. They had no pockets. But on this particular occasion the swimming guard told us we weren't allowed to swim, he said we weren't dressed appropiately. I was confused. I looked around and pointed out
          boys
          who were wearing baggy clothing, with pockets full of water. Clearly a greater drowning hazard than the genuine swimming kits we were wearing.

          <br><br>

          I knew something was wrong. I felt it in my <b><i>gut</i></b> it wasn't about how we were dressed, I can't exactly remember how it all went down but it was the first time I had <b><i>raised my voice</b></i> at a fully grown caucasian man. I
          knew enough to know we
          were being <b><i>discriminated</b></i> agaisnt. I used to have quite a temper, but never aggravated enough to raise my voice at an adult. Anyone raised by a strong Nigerian mother knows thats uncharted territory.

          <br><br>

          Out of anger and emotion I started to cry, my older siblings had to come and get us. I refused to back down. I felt as though I needed to protect my younger sister.
          I was in such a state, but I vaguely remember a lady trying to console me. When we got home I struggled to articulate the situation to my mum. But <b><i>she understood</b></i>. I thought I would get reprimanded but I didn't,
          because she understood exactly. <br><br> Mini me learnt that day it wasn't only kids that could be mean.

          <br><br>

          But back to this piece. Black woman in the media aren't always represented in the best light. And its just a <b><i>reflection of reality</i></b>. That is why I find inspiration in woman like Solange,
          an unapologetical black woman. I guess its easier to be a carefree black girl in a world where finances aren't a problem, but any representation is still good representation.
          When I first listened to her album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3Yko2SxDk4hc6fncIBQlcM?si=pyGWanmOQayjghQB4hffQw" target="_blank"><b><i>a Seat at the Table</b></i></a>, I cried abit. Sometimes you have to hear something to
          realise you've really been holding alot in.

          <br><br>

          I painted her in a Mona Lisa-esk style, an ode to black woman. <b><i>We are works of art.</b></i> This is an ode to all the strong <b><i>black mothers</b></i> out there. All the strong <b><i>black woman navigating new spaces</b></i>.
          Trying to establish a seat at the table. If it wasn't for my mother I wouldn't be where I am today. The biggest source of <b><i>inspiration</i></b> in my life.

          To all the black woman reading this. You are worthy of love, and worthy of life. <br><b><i>A life you choose to live.</b></i>

          <br><br>

          You know sometimes I wish I had the same bold, youthful sense of defiance.
          <br> However, I don't think the <b><i>flame</b></i> ever completely died. I channel it into everything I do. Every door I walk through and application I make.
          <br><br><i>At the end of the day we are living for others. I don't exactly know my purpose yet but I know I want to pave a path for people just like me, to have it a little easier.
            Just how people before me made it easier for me to be where I am today. I find inspiration in numerous black woman. I hope I can be that to someone one day, because I understand how important it is.</i>

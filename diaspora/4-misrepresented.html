        <p><b><i>I was angry. Angry at the world, angry at the media, just angry.</b></i>

          <br><br>

        <p>The way black woman are treated, spoken about is so disgusting. Serena Williams too manly to be a woman.
          Everyone having something to say about Michelle Obama. Sandra Bland. Colourism. Seeing how the black woman in my life were being treated.
          I was just mad.

          <br><br>

          Writing this now I feel the same anger.

          <br><br>

          Just <b><i>existing</i></b> is a problem for some people. It as though we have to surpress certain parts of ourselves in fear of being seen as the angry black woman.
          Having to work twice as hard, not to prove yourself to others but to prove to yourself, you are just as capable. Just as deserving. Fear of being overlooked.
          Fear of failure. Fear of racism. Growing up and being cautious. Having to <b><i>humble</i></b> yourself enough to take things on the chin.

          <br><br>

          I was between the age of 10-13, and my sister and I had been going to the same swimming pool every summer. It was a summer holiday thing, a free incentive to keep kids fit during the summer.
          We were wearing the same swimming kits every time we went. I was wearing a long full body swim suit, and my younger sister a normal swim kit with PE shorts on top. They had no pockets.
          And on this one occasion a swimming guard told us we weren't allowed to swim because of what we were wearing. I was confused. I looked around and pointed out boys
          who were wearing baggy clothing, with pockets that were full of water. Clearly much more of a drowning hazard than the genuine swimming kits we were wearing. I knew something was wrong,
          I knew it couldn't be because of the swimming kits we were wearing. I can't remember how it all went down but it was the first time I had raised my voice at a fully grown caucasian man.
          I knew we were being discriminated agaisnt. I used to have quite a temper, but never had I got aggravated enough to raise my voice at an adult. Anyone raised by a strong Nigerian mother knows
          thats uncharted territory.

          <br><br>

          I was so angry and emotional I started crying, and my older siblings had to come and get us. I refused to back down, I felt as though I needed to protect my younger sister.
          I was in such a state, I vaguely remember a lady trying to console me. I couldn't even completely explain the situation to my mum. But she understood. I thought I would get reprimanded but I didn't,
          because she understood exactly. <br><br> Mini me learnt that day it wasn't only kids that could be mean.

          <br><br>

          But back to this piece. Black woman in media aren't always represented in the best light. And its just a reflection of reality. That is why I find inspiration in woman like Solange,
          an unapologetical black woman. I guess its easier to be a carefree black girl in a world where finances aren't a problem, but any representation is still good representation.
          When I first listened to her album, a Seat at the Table, I cried abit. Sometimes you just have to hear something to realise you've really been holding alot in.

          <br><br>

          I painted her in a Mona Lisa-esk style, an ode to black woman. <b><i>We are works of art.</b></i> This is an ode to all the strong <b><i>black mothers</b></i> out there. All the strong black woman navigating new spaces.
          Trying to establish a seat at the table. If it wasn't for my mother I wouldn't be where I am today. The biggest source of <b><i>inspiration</i></b> in my life.

          To all the black woman reading this. You are worthy of love, and worthy of life. <b><i>A life you choose to live.</b></i>

          <br><br>

          You know sometimes I wish I had that same bold, childish defiance.
          <br> However, I don't think the <b><i>flame</b></i> ever completely died. I channel it into everything I do. Every door I walk through. Ever application I make.
          <br><br><i>At the end of the day we are living for others, I don't exactly know my purpose yet but I know I want to pave a path for people just like me, to have it a little easier.
            Just how people before me made it easier for me to be where I am today. I find inspiration in numerous black woman. I hope I can be that to someone one day, because I know how important it is.</i>

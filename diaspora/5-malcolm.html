        <h1>Malcolm</h1>

        <p><b><i>Unfiltered truth, the epitome of activism. Words powerful enough to awaken the masses.</b></i>

          <br><br>

          I remember during Art GCSE telling my teacher I wanted to paint Malcolm X, and she kind of discouraged me from it.
          I think it was because my work was becoming quite <i>political</i> (i'm using this term very loosely). Infact, the only reason
          I painted the Albert Einstein piece you saw on my home page was because she encouraged me to paint other important <b><i>figures in history</b></i>.

          <br><br>

          I don't exactly remember how the conversation went, but I know we had to send her images of people we wanted to paint so
          she could enlarge and print the reference images. Don't get me wrong, my art teacher was amazing (if you're reading this Ms H I still
          paint, and because of you will never stop), and I don't think she meant any harm by it but I do wish I had spoke up and really asked her <b><i>why</i></b>.

          <br><br>

          But I just accepted it and kept it moving.

          <br><br>

          Thinking back to Art GCSE makes me really <b><i>nostalgic</b></i>. I never realised how precious those moments were. Spending hours
          painting, and talking. The sun shining through the windows. In a way it was therapy, I would never leave an art class in a bad mood.

          <br><br>

          Fast forward to finishing the first year of university, I hadn't picked up a paint brush since summer. I say art is therapy yet with the busyness
          of university and my <b><i>fear of failure</b></i>, I never thought to paint to ease my stress. I realised I never completed <i><b>Diaspora</b></i>.
          The first muse that came to mind was Malcolm X.

          <br><br>

          To some Malcolm X is a violent activist. To me Malcolm X is a reminder to not only speak my truth, but to choose my words wisely. From casual racism, to constant micro-aggressions.
          The black experience is riddled with injusticies and it's so easy to give up and say nothing will really change. <b><i>Everyone has their own fight</b></i>, but we must have <b><i>empathy</i></b>.
          Figures like Malcolm X remind me to step outside my own world view; think about how my actions today can possibily benefit other people. Malcolm did not have to speak out for others, but
          he did. He gave a voice to the <b><i>powerless</b></i>. And to me that is a great role model.

          <br><br>

          <i> I wanted to explore with the <b> background </b> of this piece, so I painted an abstract print that resembles Nigerian traditional clothing.</i>

                    <h1>Malcolm</h1>

                    <p><b><i>Unfiltered truth, the epitome of activism. Words powerful enough to awaken the masses.</b></i>
                                        
                    <br><br>

                    I remember during Art GCSE telling my teacher I wanted to paint Malcolm X, and she kind of discouraged me from it.
                    I think it was because my work was becoming quite <i>political</i> (i'm using this term very loosely). Infact, the only reason 
                    I painted the Albert Einstein piece you saw on my home page was because she encouraged me to paint other important <b><i>figures in history</b></i>.

                    <br><br>

                    I don't exactly remember how the conversation went, but I know we had to send her images of people we wanted to paint so
                    she could to enlarge and print the reference images. Don't get me wrong, my art teacher was amazing (if you're reading this Ms H I still 
                    paint, and because of you will never stop painting), and I don't think she meant any harm by it but I do wish I had spoke up and really asked her <b><i>why</i></b>.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    But I just accepted it and kept it moving.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    Thinking back to GCSE Art makes me really <b><i>nostalgic</b></i>. I never realised how precious those moments were. Spending hours
                     painting, and talking. The sun shining through the windows. Art is therapy in its purest form, I would never leave an art class in a bad mood.

                    <br><br>

                    Fast forward to finishing the first year of university, I hadn't picked up a paint brush since summer. I say art is therapy yet with the busyness
                     of university and my <b><i>fear of failure</b></i>, I never thought to paint to ease my stress. I realised I never completed <i><b>Diaspora</b></i>,
                    the first muse that came to mind was Malcolm X. It was a no brainer, I had to paint him. 

                    <br><br>

                    To some Malcolm X is a violent activist. To me Malcolm X is a reminder to not only speak my truth, but to choose my words wisely. From casual racism, to constant microaggressions. 
                    The black experience is riddled with injusticies and its so easy to give up and say nothing will really change. <b><i>Everyone has their own fight</b></i>, but we must also have <b><i>empathy</i></b>.
                    Figures like Malcolm X remind me to step outside my own world view; think about how my actions today can possibily benefit other people. Malcolm did not have to speak out for others, but
                     he did. He gave a voice to the <b><i>powerless</b></i>. And to me that is a great role model.
                     
                    <br><br>

                    <i> I wanted to Explore Painting with the <b> background </b> of this piece, so I painted an abstract print that resembles Nigerian traditional clothing.</i>

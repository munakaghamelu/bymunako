                    <br>
                    
                    <p>A well spoken individual. Unafraid of the consquences of speaking out, unafraid of voicing .

                    I remember during Art GCSE telling my teacher I wanted to paint Malcolm X, and she kind of discouraged me from it.
                    I think it was because my work was becoming really political, I was painting alot of black people. Infact the only reason I painted
                    the Albert Einstein piece you saw on my home page was a result of her encouraging me to paint other important figures in history.

                    <br><br>

                    I don't remember exactly how the conversation went, but I know we always had to send her images of people we wanted to paint because
                    she needed to enlarge it and print. Don't get me wrong my art teacher was amazing (if you're reading this Ms H I still paint, and because
                    of you will never stop painting), and I don't think she meant any harm by it and I wish we had, had more of a discussion on it.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    Thinking back to my GCSE art lessons makes me really nostalgic, I never realised how precious those moments were. Spending hours
                     painting, and talking. The sun shining through the windows. Art is therapy in its purest form. It brings about clarity and even happiness.

                    <br><br>

                    Fast forward to finishing the first year of university, I hadn't picked up a paint brush since summer. I say art is therapy yet with the busyness
                     of university and my fear of failure I never thought to paint to ease my stress. I realised I never completed the art series I started last summer,
                    so the idea of painting Malcolm X was perfect. The epitome of a strong, black activist.

                    <br><br>

                    Someone who was completely unafraid and unapolegetic when speaking up about what he believed in. To me Malcolm X is important because he reminds me its
                     okay to speak up. To not stay silent when I think something isn't morally

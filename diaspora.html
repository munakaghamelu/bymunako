        <h1>Diaspora</h1>

        <p><b><i> the dispersion or spread of any people from their original homeland.</b></i>

          <br><br>

          I began this series in the summer of 2019. Free from A levels and apprehensive to create. As mentioned in my <a href="./artist.html"><b><i>Artist</i></b></a> section, I'm an avid overthinker.
          So I began reflecting on the past 2 years of my life. Having moved from the lively city of Manchester to rural Cheshire, to say it was simply a cultural shock would be the understatement
          of the century. Nevertheless, I was determined to navigate this new space and still make something out of myself. So there I was, during a night shift, questioning my identity.

          <br><br>

          I felt as though I had lost a part of myself, my culture and possibly my <i>"blackness"</i>.
          Are we simply products of our environment? I came to the premature conclusion that moving out of Manchester was synonymous with losing my identity.

          <br><br>

          I was in a state of constant conflicting thoughts and emotions. I knew I missed my city, the culture and the friends I grew up with. But what I didn't know was how much I had changed in 2 years.
          Don't get me wrong, I made new friends and still played basketball (a sport that shaped most of my high school experience). <br><br> So what changed? I definelty felt as though I was more introverted and yes - more of an overthinker.
          I had never been in a space where I was the only one that looked like me.

          <br><br>

          So it was after my first painting <b><i>Floating Tribe</i></b>, I decided to make this into a Series. Diaspora is an ode to rediscovering myself. Discovering who I had become
          and the things in society that influence who I am. I guess 'Diaspora' to me is a Nigerian-Brit trying to navigate a space outside her comfort zone. I wanted to illustrate my thoughts.

          <br><br>

          Diaspora allowed me to understand that <b><i>growth</i></b> isn't finite, being <b><i>black</i></b> is complicated and <b><i>self love</i></b> is really just trying not to be so hard on yourself.

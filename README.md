# Art Website by Muna K.A.

I created this website to better explain my allegory of art.

I also wanted to practice creating a website from scratch and pick up bits 
of javascript along the way to prepare me for further app development projects.

This code is open source so feel free to use this repository as a template for your website, but please credit me.

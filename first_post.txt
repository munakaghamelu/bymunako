Munachimso Kosarachi Aghamelu, born in London, raised in Manchester but a Nigerian through and through.

The older I get and the more spaces I come to navigate, the more I want to better understand my everyday thoughts and life experiences.

As a black woman just beginning to step into the tech industry, I often think about the things that got me to where I am today and whether imposter syndrome is a real thing. As an artist, I find it easier to express my ideas on race and life through the acrylic medium. As an avid overthinker I find myself pondering on issues that don’t directly affect me but still find ways to get emotionally attached.

What do I hope to achieve from this blog?

Become a mentor.
Better explain my art.
Share my adventures.
Find my purpose.
In particular, I want young black woman wanting to go into tech to find this blog, but its not only limited to this demographic. I want to create a sort of safe space for people just like me. I want to show potential is limitless, and no matter how trying life can get we can shift perspective.

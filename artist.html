            <h1>The Artist behind the Art</h1>

            <p>Munachimso Kosarachi Aghamelu, born in London, raised in Manchester but a Nigerian through and through. 20.

            <br><br>

            The older I get and the more spaces I navigate, the more I want to better understand my everyday thoughts and life experiences.

            <br><br>

            As a black woman just beginning to step into the tech industry, I often think about the things that got me to where I am today and whether 
            imposter syndrome is a real thing. As an artist, I find it easier to express my ideas on race and life through the acrylic medium. And as an avid 
            overthinker I find myself pondering issues that don't directly affect me, piecing together solutions in my mind.

            <br><br>

            So... welcome to 'BY MUNA KO'. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Alot of blood, sweat and coding went into the creation of this space.
            <br> My artist space. A space to showcase my work, and better explain each piece.

            <br><br>

            What do I hope to achieve from this website?

            <br><br>

            Become a mentor.
            Better explain my art.
            Find my purpose.

            <br><br>

            Oh, and i'll definetly be that aunty in 20 years time that has art all over her walls - because as well as creating art, I love finding inspiration
            in other bodies of work.
